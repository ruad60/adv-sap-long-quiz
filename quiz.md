## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
**1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).**
SOA or Service Oriented Architecture is a kind of aproach to software development which allows the user to
fully utalize the software components and services of a system, this can help big companies such as Microsoft 
to offer much greater benifits to thier user as they can reuse parts of a software to create a new software for a
different perpose

**2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.**
- First of the characteristic of the SOA is the Standardized Service Contracts, as the name sugest, these are services
that use service contracts.
- Next is the Loose Coupling, this characteristic of the SOA allows the Services offered by the software to have 
minimal dependencies, this is to ensure that every service contract has their on dependencies onces implemented.
- Thirdly is the Abstraction, this characteristic of the SOA allows the services to avoid any unessesary data leak
and hides information to protect the services privacy as it allows the preservation of relationship and dependencies
that have been implemented.
- The Fourth characteristic of the SOA is Service Reusability, this part of the SOA,as the name suggest, allows the services 
to be reused as much as possible.
- Fifth characteristic of the SOA is Autonomy, this, as the name would imply, makes it so that the SOA can act autonomously
by itself and allows the software to run without the help of outside interference, this allows the services to be much more
reliable as it can run by itself.
- The Sixth characteristic of SOA is Statelessness, this ensures that the services to be stateless, allowing the service to be far
more scalable as it has no constant state.
- The Seventh SOA characteristic is Discoverability, this allows the services to be discovered at any given moment as the 
metadata can be stored in a document.
- The Eight SOA characteristic is Composability, this allows the services to breakup problems into much smaller problems
which can help with the reusability of a servicesm it also allows the services to be much more efficient that it already is.
- The final characteristic of SOA is the Interoperability this allows the software services to much effectively make use
of the information  it is provided which would allow the services to attune to the users.

**3. Define Microservices.**
Microservices is similar to SOA as it utalize the reusable software component the only difference being that microservices
focuses on a single applications

**4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.**
- Firstly is Independently deployable,one of its benifits is that it can be deployed independently, this is becauase it only 
need to focus on a single service.
- Another one of the benifits of microservices is that since it focuses on single applications it can utalize all of its 
fucntion just to focus on that one services it needs to operate
- Lastly is that microservices can be precisely scaled as they only need focus on single services, which  in turn manimizes
the amount of infrustructure that it would need as it would only need to single out an application.

**5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.**
- As discussed earlier the SOA and Microservices are similar in that both uses reusability to maximize the use of services that
they can bring, however the difference between the two is that first of all the Microservices are faster that SOA as the
microservices only need to focus on a single application.
- Nextly is that since SOA focuses on wide range services while the microservices focuses on singular service application
Lastly is scallabiliy, as said earlier since SOA is much wide range than microservices it would also mean that the scale on which
they can be applied as is also in a different scale.

**6. Define Web Services.**
From what i understand by reading the handout and searching online, web services are piece of software, mostly located in 
systems, which are collections of protocols that is used by the system to connect over and exchange data with other
programs, furthermore web services it helps the overall program in one way or another by tying in multiple parts of said
system

**7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.**
- There are many benifits in using webservices , similar to micro services, web services are able to work and fucntion
independently, the only difference is that web services can share data and info to other web services to ensure that every
piece of the application is functional and can be independent on thier own
- Another benifit of web services is that it is low-cost as you can use already existing internet to start the implemintation of
these web services, and since the web services uses the internet protocols such as HTTP(***Hyper Text Transfer Protocol***)
and SOAP(***Simple Object Access Protocol***), we can be certain that these can be reliable and effective in our systems

**8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.**
- Firstly is web services being XML-based
  Since the web services uses XML-Based  data, we can be sure that web services can be sure that data exchange among
system are working as they are able to share data with each other
- Second is Loosely Coupled
  just like SOA, these web services are not restrained to the users of said system, meaning these web services are able to make
interactions with each other as so
- Thirdly is Coarse-Grained
  since these webservices are caplable of exposing individual services using different functions and methods, though the
exposed should be coarse grained as it provide just the exact amont of data to pass through
 - Fourth is Web services ability to be Synchronous and Asynchronous
  this allows the webserves to act simultaneously or not, this help the web services to be able to integrate being capable of
loosely coupling as it can helpful in a lot of situations
- Fifth is Supports Remote Procedure cells
  with this we are able to access and use multiple web protocols and we can are able to provide other interfaces by invoking
these particular sirvices from other aplications
- Lastly is Supports Document Exchange 
  as stated in earlier answers since XML allows excange of data of not just simple but complex category of documents, we
can be certain that the webservices are able of passing dara from one software to another

**9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.**
Acording to the hadout, there are 6 roles within Web Services architechture these are
- The Provider- these are those resposible in creating the web services themselves
- The Requestor- these are the application that requre the web services which the Provider creates
- The Broker- these are applications that procides access to the web services that the Provider created
- The Publish- these are the Broker's publish interface which helps evertyhing see accessible web services
- The Find- these are the Requester's input to the Broker to find published web services
- The Bind- these are information the Broker gained about the web service that the Requestor asked to find and if the Broker
is able to Bind these web services

**10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.**
-SOAP(***Simple Object Access Protocol***)- these are XML based protocol that allows the transfer of data and information
between multiple computers
- WSDL(***Web Services Description Language***)- these are XML based language which is used for analyzing and accessing
web services
- UDDI(***Universal Description, Discovery and integration***)- these are XML based standards which help as use and utalyze
the roles of Web Service architechture , like publishing and finding web services
